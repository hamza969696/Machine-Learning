# Machine-Learning
This project aims to predict whether a user will complete a transaction on an e-commerce website based on historical data. Leveraging different machine learning algorithms, the model analyzes user interactions, including browsing history, demographics, and previous transaction records, to determine the likelihood of a successful transaction. By employing predictive models, statistical analyses, and data preprocessing techniques, this project enhances the website's ability to make informed decisions and optimize user experience.
